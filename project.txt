EDUBOT PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
============================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
------------------
Edubot is a modern educational management platform built with a focus on AI integration, role-based access control, and a seamless user experience. It facilitates interactions between Students and Lecturers, managing subjects, assessments, and grading with an integrated AI assistant.

2. ARCHITECTURE & TECH STACK
---------------------------
The project is organized as a Monorepo using Turborepo for orchestration and Bun as the primary runtime and package manager.

Root Structure:
- /apps: Contains the main applications (client, server).
- /packages: Contains shared configurations (eslint, typescript, ui).
- turbo.json: Turborepo configuration for task pipelining.
- package.json: Root dependencies and workspace definitions.

2.1 BACKEND (apps/server)
-------------------------
A high-performance API built with Hono.js and Node.js/Bun.

Core Technologies:
- Runtime: Bun
- Framework: Hono.js (Ultra-fast web framework)
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose (ODM)
- Validation: Zod (Schema-first validation)
- AI Logic: Groq SDK (Llama 3 integration)
- Security: JWT Authentication using `jose`

Directory Structure:
- src/index.ts: Application entry point, middleware setup (CORS, Logger), and database connection initialization.
- src/api/v1/app: Contains Controllers and Routes.
- src/api/v1/models: Mongoose schemas for User, Subject, Assessment, Grade, and Enrollment.
- src/api/v1/services: Business logic layers for complex operations (e.g., AI chat processing, grading logic).
- src/api/v1/utils: Helper functions, custom error handling, and environment variable management.

Key Features:
- Modular API routing under /api/v1.
- Robust error handling with custom `CustomError` class and middleware.
- Health check endpoint for system monitoring.

2.2 FRONTEND (apps/client)
--------------------------
A modern, responsive SPA built with React 19 and Vite.

Core Technologies:
- UI Framework: React 19
- Build Tool: Vite
- Routing: TanStack Router (Type-safe routing)
- Data Fetching: TanStack Query (Server state management)
- State Management: Zustand (Client state management)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 (Utility-first styling)
- Components: Radix UI primitives + Custom UI components (Shadcn based)
- Animations: Framer Motion
- Notifications: Sonner

Directory Structure:
- src/main.tsx: Entry point for the React application.
- src/routes: File-based routing system. Includes `_authenticated` layout group for protected routes.
- src/components: Reusable UI components, including specialized components for chat, dashboards, and tables.
- src/hooks: Custom hooks for API interactions (TanStack Query hooks) and UI logic.
- src/auth: Authentication logic and Zustand store for user session management.

Key Features:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Differentiates between Student and Lecturer views.
- Dynamic Dashboards: Interactive visualizations using Recharts.
- AI Chat Interface: A premium AI-powered assistant for students and lecturers.
- Type-safe API communication through TanStack Query and generated route trees.

3. DATABASE MODELS & RELATIONSHIPS
---------------------------------
- User: Stores credentials, profile info, and roles (Student/Lecturer).
- Subject: Represents courses offered.
- Enrollment: Links Students to Subjects they are taking.
- Assessment: Quizzes and tests created by Lecturers for specific Subjects.
- Grade: Records Student performance on Assessments.

4. SYSTEM FLOW & INTEGRATION
----------------------------
- Authentication: Handled via the `/users/login` endpoint on the server, returning a JWT. The client stores this session in a Zustand `auth-store` and includes the token in API requests.
- Authorization: Protected routes on the client use a Tanstack-Router beforeLoad function. The server validates roles via middleware.
- AI Interaction: The client sends messages to `/chat`. The server processes these using Groq (Llama 3) with specialized educational prompts to assist students.
- Data Flow: TanStack Query manages the lifecycle of data fetching, caching, and synchronization between the Hono API and the React UI.

5. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
-----------------------
- Package Management: Uses `bun` exclusively.
- Running Locally: `bun dev` from the root starts both the client (port 3001) and server (default port) concurrently via Turbo.
- Build Process: `bun run build` triggers optimized builds for both applications.
- Linting/Formatting: Enforced via Prettier and ESLint across the monorepo.

6. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
-------------------
The project prioritizes a "Premium" feel with:
- Glassmorphism effects in the AI interface.
- Smooth transitions and micro-animations.
- A consistent Dark/Light mode theme system.
- Responsive layouts tailored for both desktop and mobile usage.
